                           "Doing another workout before your body has had a chance to fully repair the broken down muscles from your first workout would obviously be counterproductive. Workouts in the size and strength program are intense to stimulate the muscle to grow, but short so you don’t over train.",
                           "There are three main stress hormones in the body; cortisol, catecholamines and Neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY is only released during times of perceived chronic stress.",
                           "NPY is particularly evil in that unlike the catecholamines and cortisol, which are mainly catabolic hormones (i.e. they burn fat), NPY makes you gain fat. When NPY is released in large amounts, it causes fat cells to go from immature baby fat cells to full-grown, mature fat cells. To make matters even worse, cortisol enhances the efficiency of NYP to develop more fat cells.",
